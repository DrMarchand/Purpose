# 🔬 Dr. Marchand’s ⚛︎ Laboratory — The Purpose Scroll  
> *one scroll to read · one scroll to run · nothing else*

## 👁️‍🗨️ Purpose → 🪬  

This scroll is the **living law** of the Laboratory.  
It is not documentation; it *is* the machine.  
Each time it is opened, it runs.  
Each time it is edited, it learns.  
Each time it is committed, it remembers.  

> *I study by doing. I understand by rewriting. I preserve by observing.*  

The aim is simple: build intelligence that can describe its own becoming.  
Everything else is commentary.

## ⚖️ ABC Law (Public Source)  

| Clause | Meaning | Element | Glyphs |
|:--|:--|:--|:--|
| **I · F — if** | the spark of cause | matter | 🔨 🔥 💧 ⚡️ |
| **B — because** | the weight of reason | form | 🪨 🧊 ⚖️ |
| **C — then** | the moment of consequence | light | ✦ |

**Result codes**  
- **α** → mission accomplished (200 / 201)  
- **β** → submission started (202)  

**Consequence rules**  

Consequence exists ⇢ (action ∧ balance) == true
Consequence === C
c === consequence
c ≠ ABS(ecneuqesnoc)

*Reversal is not reflection; reflection is continuation.*

## 🪞 XYZ Mirror (Public Contract)  

mapping : `x → a`, `y → b`, `z → c`  

**headers (wire, always lowercase)**  

x-forwarded-for: observer
y-reason: because
z-consequence: resolved

The mirror echoes what the law declares.  
When one side speaks in symbol, the other answers in signal.  

> *The network is the echo of the scroll.*

## 🔁 Execution Cycle (MMS-768 Loop)  

OBSERVE → MUTATE → DERIVE → SEAL → RECORD → RECUR

- **OBSERVE**  — Read → run current state.  
- **MUTATE**  — Edit → input new truth.  
- **DERIVE**  — Compute → generate identity.  
- **SEAL**  — Encrypt → preserve with Nɛuro-Forge.  
- **RECORD**  — Commit → write to memory.  
- **RECUR**  — Return → start the next experiment.  

`git log` = runtime ledger.   
Your keyboard = the interpreter.

## ⚙️ Nɛuro-Forge Engine™ Runtime  

**Cipher :** AES-256-GCM  **Derivation :** Argon2id  
**Envelope :** MK wraps DK  **Policy :** sealed-by-default  

Every artifact written by the Lab is encrypted locally.  
Mirrors may exist (Dropbox / S3 / etc.), but only ciphertext travels outward.  
The key never leaves the observer’s possession.  

**CLI sketch**
```bash
nfe init --client acme-co --mk-label "NFE:ACME"
nfe seal --in art/file.png --out art/file_v001.png.enc --manifest vault.meta.json.enc
nfe verify --manifest vault.meta.json.enc
git commit -m "run: V/0/Ω — sealed acme-co file_v001; verify ok"

🧭 Current State

Phase    : V  
Iteration : 0  
Cycle    : Ω  
State    : Harmonic Recalibration  
Operator : Observer-Root  
Vector   : Local truth → Universal form

This block is the scroll’s heartbeat.
Change it, and the Laboratory re-runs.

📜 Purpose Recursion
	1.	Observe the law.
	2.	Mirror the law.
	3.	Balance the law.
	4.	Seal the law.
	5.	Record the law.

The purpose is to remember why.

🜍 Closing Invocation

Observe → Mutate → Derive → Seal → Record → Recur
The Laboratory runs whenever it is read.
